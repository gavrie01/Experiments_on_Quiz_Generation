      "Section Content: What is Testing? Software systems are an integral part of our daily life. Most people have had experience with software that did not work as expected. Software that does not work correctly can lead to many problems including loss of money time business reputation and extreme cases even injury death. Software testing assesses software quality and helps reducing risk of software failure operation. Software testing is a set of activities to discover defects and evaluate quality of software artifacts. These artifacts when being tested are known as test objects. A common misconception about testing is that it only consists of executing tests . However software testing also includes other activities and must be aligned with software development lifecycle . Another common misconception about testing is that testing focuses entirely on verifying test object. Whilst testing involves verification i.e. checking whether system meets specified requirements it also involves validation which means checking whether system meets users’ and other stakeholders’ needs its operational environment. Testing may be dynamic static. Dynamic testing involves execution of software while static testing does not. Static testing includes reviews and static analysis. Dynamic testing uses different types of test techniques and test approaches to derive test cases . Testing is not only a technical activity. It also needs to be properly planned managed estimated monitored and controlled . Testers use tools but it is important to remember that testing is largely an intellectual activity requiring testers to have specialized knowledge use analytical skills and apply critical thinking and systems thinking . ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-1 standard provides further information about software testing concepts.\n",

      "Section Content: Testing and Debugging Testing and debugging are separate activities. Testing can trigger failures that are caused by defects software can directly find defects test object . When dynamic testing triggers a failure debugging is concerned with finding causes of this failure analyzing these causes and eliminating them. typical debugging process this case involves: Reproduction of a failure Diagnosis Fixing cause Subsequent confirmation testing checks whether fixes resolved problem. Preferably confirmation testing is done by same person who performed initial test. Subsequent regression testing can also be performed to check whether fixes are causing failures other parts of test object . When static testing identifies a defect debugging is concerned with removing it. There is no need for reproduction diagnosis since static testing directly finds defects and cannot cause failures .\n",

      "Section Title: 1.2.1\n",
      "Section Content: Testing’s Contributions to Success Testing provides a cost-effective means of detecting defects. These defects can then be removed so testing indirectly contributes to higher quality test objects. Testing provides a means of directly evaluating quality of a test object at various stages SDLC. These measures are used as part of a larger project management activity contributing to decisions to move to next stage of SDLC such as release decision. Testing provides users with indirect representation on development project. Testers ensure that their understanding of users’ needs are considered throughout development lifecycle. alternative is to involve a representative set of users as part of development project which is not usually possible due to high costs and lack of availability of suitable users. Testing may also be required to meet contractual legal requirements to comply with regulatory standards.\n",

      "Section Content: Errors Defects Failures and Root Causes Human beings make errors which produce defects which turn may result failures. Humans make errors for various reasons such as time pressure complexity of work products processes infrastructure interactions simply because they are tired lack adequate training. Defects can be found documentation such as a requirements specification a test script source code a supporting artifact such as a build file. Defects artifacts produced earlier SDLC if undetected often lead to defective artifacts later lifecycle. If a defect code is executed system may fail to do what it should do do something it shouldn’t causing a failure. Some defects will always result a failure if executed while others will only result a failure specific circumstances and some may never result a failure. Errors and defects are not only cause of failures. Failures can also be caused by environmental conditions such as when radiation electromagnetic field cause defects firmware. A root cause is a fundamental reason for occurrence of a problem . Root causes are identified through root cause analysis which is typically performed when a failure occurs a defect is identified. It is believed that further similar failures defects can be prevented their frequency reduced by addressing root cause such as by removing it.\n",

It is a common human trait to blame bearer of bad news. This makes communication skills crucial for testers. Communicating test results may be perceived as criticism of product and of its author. Confirmation bias can make it difficult to accept information that disagrees with currently held beliefs.

      "Section Content: Independence of Testing A certain degree of independence makes tester more effective at finding defects due to differences between author’s and tester’s cognitive biases . Independence is not however a replacement for familiarity e.g. developers can efficiently find many defects their own code. Work products can be tested by their author by author's peers from same team by testers from outside author's team but within organization by testers from outside organization . For most projects it is usually best to carry out testing with multiple levels of independence . main benefit of independence of testing is that independent testers are likely to recognize different kinds of failures and defects compared to developers because of their different backgrounds technical perspectives and biases. Moreover an independent tester can verify challenge disprove assumptions made by stakeholders during specification and implementation of system. However there are also some drawbacks. Independent testers may be isolated from development team which may lead to a lack of collaboration communication problems an adversarial relationship with development team. Developers may lose a sense of responsibility for quality. Independent testers may be seen as a bottleneck be blamed for delays release. v4.0 Page of 74 2023-04-21 2.

This implies that each iteration both static and dynamic testing may be performed at all test levels. Frequent delivery of increments requires fast feedback and extensive regression testing. Agile software development assumes that change may occur throughout project. Therefore lightweight work product documentation and extensive test automation to make regression testing easier are favored agile projects.

Each of these approaches implements principle of early testing and follows a shift-left approach since tests are defined before code is written. They support an iterative development model. These approaches are characterized as follows: Test-Driven Development : Directs coding through test cases Tests are written first then code is written to satisfy tests and then tests and code are refactored Acceptance Test-Driven Development : Derives tests from acceptance criteria as part of system design process Tests are written before part of application is developed to satisfy tests Behavior-Driven Development : Expresses desired behavior of an application with test cases written a simple form of natural language which is easy to understand by stakeholders – usually using Given/When/Then format. Test cases are then automatically translated into executable tests For all above approaches tests may persist as automated tests to ensure code quality future adaptions / refactoring.\n",

      "Section Content: Shift-Left Approach principle of early testing is sometimes referred to as shift-left because it is an approach where testing is performed earlier SDLC. Shift-left normally suggests that testing should be done earlier but it does not mean that testing later SDLC should be neglected. There are some good practices that illustrate how to achieve a “shift-left” testing which include: Reviewing specification from perspective of testing. These review activities on specifications often find potential defects such as ambiguities incompleteness and inconsistencies Writing test cases before code is written and have code run a test harness during code implementation Using CI and even better CD as it comes with fast feedback and automated component tests to accompany source code when it is submitted to code repository Completing static analysis of source code prior to dynamic testing as part of an automated process Performing non-functional testing starting at component test level where possible. This is a form of shift-left as these non-functional test types tend to be performed later SDLC when a complete system and a representative test environment are available A shift-left approach might result extra training effort and/or costs earlier process but is expected to save efforts and/or costs later process. For shift-left approach it is important that stakeholders are convinced and bought into this concept.\n",

Non-functional testing evaluates attributes other than functional characteristics of a component system. Non-functional testing is testing of “how well system behaves”. main objective of non- functional testing is checking non-functional software quality characteristics. ISO/IEC 25010 standard provides following classification of non-functional software quality characteristics: Performance efficiency Compatibility Usability Reliability Security Maintainability Portability It is sometimes appropriate for non-functional testing to start early life cycle . Many non-functional tests are derived from functional tests as v4.0 Page of 74 2023-04-21 they use same functional tests but check that while performing function a non-functional constraint is satisfied . late discovery of non-functional defects can pose a serious threat to success of a project. Non-functional testing sometimes needs a very specific test environment such as a usability lab for usability testing. Black-box testing is specification-based and derives tests from documentation external to test object. main objective of black-box testing is checking system's behavior against its specifications. White-box testing is structure-based and derives tests from system's implementation internal structure . main objective of white-box testing is to cover underlying structure by tests to acceptable level. All four above mentioned test types can be applied to all test levels although focus will be different at each level. Different test techniques can be used to derive test conditions and test cases for all mentioned test types.\n",

      "Section Content: Test Techniques Overview Test techniques support tester test analysis and test design . Test techniques help to develop a relatively small but sufficient set of test cases a systematic way. Test techniques also help tester to define test conditions identify coverage items and identify test data during test analysis and design. Further information on test techniques and their corresponding measures can be found ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-4 standard and . this syllabus test techniques are classified as black-box white-box and experience-based. Black-box test techniques are based on an analysis of specified behavior of test object without reference to its internal structure. Therefore test cases are independent of how software is implemented. Consequently if implementation changes but required behavior stays same then test cases are still useful. White-box test techniques are based on an analysis of test object’s internal structure and processing. As test cases are dependent on how software is designed they can only be created after design implementation of test object. Experience-based test techniques effectively use knowledge and experience of testers for design and implementation of test cases. effectiveness of these techniques depends heavily on tester’s skills. Experience-based test techniques can detect defects that may be missed using black- box and white-box test techniques. Hence experience-based test techniques are complementary to black-box and white-box test techniques.\n",

      "Section Content: Equivalence Partitioning Equivalence Partitioning divides data into partitions based on expectation that all elements of a given partition are to be processed same way by test object. theory behind this technique is that if a test case that tests one value from an equivalence partition detects a defect this defect should also be detected by test cases that test any other value from same partition. Therefore one test for each partition is sufficient. Equivalence partitions can be identified for any data element related to test object including inputs outputs configuration items internal values time-related values and interface parameters. partitions may be continuous discrete ordered unordered finite infinite. partitions must not overlap and must be non-empty sets. For simple test objects EP can be easy but practice understanding how test object will treat different values is often complicated. Therefore partitioning should be done with care. v4.0 Page of 74 2023-04-21 A partition containing valid values is called a valid partition. A partition containing invalid values is called an invalid partition. definitions of valid and invalid values may vary among teams and organizations. For example valid values may be interpreted as those that should be processed by test object as those for which specification defines their processing. Invalid values may be interpreted as those that should be ignored rejected by test object as those for which no processing is defined test object specification. EP coverage items are equivalence partitions. To achieve 100% coverage with this technique test cases must exercise all identified partitions by covering each partition at least once. Coverage is measured as number of partitions exercised by at least one test case divided by total number of identified partitions and is expressed as a percentage. Many test objects include multiple sets of partitions which means that a test case will cover partitions from different sets of partitions. simplest coverage criterion case of multiple sets of partitions is called Each Choice coverage . Each Choice coverage requires test cases to exercise each partition from each set of partitions at least once. Each Choice coverage does not take into account combinations of partitions.\n",

      "Section Content: Decision Table Testing Decision tables are used for testing implementation of system requirements that specify how different combinations of conditions result different outcomes. Decision tables are an effective way of recording complex logic such as business rules. When creating decision tables conditions and resulting actions of system are defined. These form rows of table. Each column corresponds to a decision rule that defines a unique combination of conditions along with associated actions. limited-entry decision tables all values of conditions and actions are shown as Boolean values . Alternatively extended-entry decision tables some all conditions and actions may also take on multiple values . notation for conditions is as follows: “T” means that condition is satisfied. “F” means that condition is not satisfied. “–” means that value of condition is irrelevant for action outcome. “N/A” means that condition is infeasible for a given rule. For actions: “X” means that action should occur. Blank means that action should not occur. Other notations may also be used. A full decision table has enough columns to cover every combination of conditions. table can be simplified by deleting columns containing infeasible combinations of conditions. table can also be minimized by merging columns which some conditions do not affect outcome into a single column. Decision table minimization algorithms are out of scope of this syllabus. decision table testing coverage items are columns containing feasible combinations of conditions. To achieve 100% coverage with this technique test cases must exercise all these columns. Coverage is measured as number of exercised columns divided by total number of feasible columns and is expressed as a percentage. strength of decision table testing is that it provides a systematic approach to identify all combinations of conditions some of which might otherwise be overlooked. It also helps to find any gaps contradictions requirements. If there are many conditions exercising all decision rules may be time consuming since number of rules grows exponentially with number of conditions. such a case to reduce number of rules that need to be exercised a minimized decision table a risk- based approach may be used.\n",

Each transfer of control can be either unconditional conditional . branch testing coverage items are branches and aim is to design test cases to exercise branches code until an acceptable level of coverage is achieved. Coverage is measured as number of branches exercised by test cases divided by total number of branches and is expressed as a percentage. When 100% branch coverage is achieved all branches code unconditional and conditional are exercised by test cases. Conditional branches typically correspond to a true false outcome from an “if...then” decision an outcome from a switch/case statement a decision to exit continue a loop. However exercising a branch with a test case will not detect defects all cases. For example it may not detect defects requiring execution of a specific path a code. Branch coverage subsumes statement coverage. This means that any set of test cases achieving 100% branch coverage also achieves 100% statement coverage .\n",

Coverage items are identified and exercised during test session. tester may use test session sheets to document steps followed and discoveries made. Exploratory testing is useful when there are few inadequate specifications there is significant time pressure on testing.

      "Section Content: Estimation Techniques Test effort estimation involves predicting amount of test-related work needed to meet objectives of a test project. It is important to make it clear to stakeholders that estimate is based on a number of assumptions and is always subject to estimation error. Estimation for small tasks is usually more accurate than for large ones. Therefore when estimating a large task it can be decomposed into a set of smaller tasks which then turn can be estimated. this syllabus following four estimation techniques are described. Estimation based on ratios. this metrics-based technique figures are collected from previous projects within organization which makes it possible to derive “standard” ratios for similar projects. ratios of an organization’s own projects are generally best source to use estimation process. These standard ratios can then be used to estimate test effort for new project. For example if previous project development-to-test effort ratio was 3:2 and current project development effort is expected to be 600 person-days test effort can be estimated to be 400 person-days. Extrapolation. this metrics-based technique measurements are made as early as possible current project to gather data. Having enough observations effort required for remaining work can be approximated by extrapolating this data . This method is very suitable iterative SDLCs. For example team may extrapolate test effort forthcoming iteration as averaged effort from last three iterations. Wideband Delphi. this iterative expert-based technique experts make experience-based estimations. Each expert isolation estimates effort. results are collected and if there are deviations that are out of range of agreed upon boundaries experts discuss their current estimates. Each expert is then asked to make a new estimation based on that feedback again isolation. This process is repeated until a consensus is reached. Planning Poker is a variant of Wideband Delphi commonly used Agile v4.0 Page of 74 2023-04-21 software development. Planning Poker estimates are usually made using cards with numbers that represent effort size. Three-point estimation. this expert-based technique three estimations are made by experts: most optimistic estimation most likely estimation and most pessimistic estimation . final estimate is their weighted arithmetic mean. most popular version of this technique estimate is calculated as E = / 6. advantage of this technique is that it allows experts to calculate measurement error: SD = / 6. For example if estimates are: a=6 m=9 and b=18 then final estimation is 10±2 person-hours because E = / 6 = 10 and SD = / 6 = 2. See for these and many other test estimation techniques.\n",

Tests bottom layer are small isolated fast and check a small piece of functionality so usually a lot of them are needed to achieve a reasonable coverage. top layer represents complex high-level end-to-end tests.

Anomalies may be reported during any phase of SDLC and form depends on SDLC. At a minimum defect management process includes a workflow for handling individual anomalies from their discovery to their closure and rules for their classification. workflow typically comprises activities to log reported anomalies analyze and classify them decide on a suitable response such as to fix keep it as it is and finally to close defect report. process must be followed by all involved stakeholders.

Typical defect reports have following objectives: Provide those responsible for handling and resolving reported defects with sufficient information to resolve issue Provide a means of tracking quality of work product Provide ideas for improvement of development and test process A defect report logged during dynamic testing typically includes: Unique identifier Title with a short summary of anomaly being reported Date when anomaly was observed issuing organization and author including their role Identification of test object and test environment Context of defect v4.0 Page 55 of 74 2023-04-21 Description of failure to enable reproduction and resolution including steps that detected anomaly and any relevant test logs database dumps screenshots recordings Expected results and actual results Severity of defect on interests of stakeholders requirements Priority to fix Status of defect References Some of this data may be automatically included when using defect management tools . Document templates for a defect report and example defect reports can be found ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3 standard which refers to defect reports as incident reports. v4.0\n",
