Here are a few experiments / attempts to generate a Qiuz out of highly structured IT specific document.
The floe is the following:
1. Transform PDF into TXT;
2. Transform text into stringIO object;
3. Remove parts of the document which do not have meaning for the experiments;
4. Perform experiments on cleaning;
5. Perform experiments on Q&A generation using pre-trained models;
6. Work is still in progress
